        <h2>Zambia's one and only Relais & Châteaux member</h2>
        <p>We are proud to be the one and only Relais & Châteaux property in Zambia and value the high standards of excellence and authenticity that such an honour prescribes.

                Established in France over 60 years ago, Relais & Châteaux unites the finest hoteliers, chefs, and restaurateurs in the world. It is an association that has set the standard for excellence in hospitality. Its mission? To spread its unique and discerning philosophy across the globe by selecting outstanding properties with truly unique character. 
                
                The story of Relais & Châteaux began in 1941 when two former music hall entertainers, Marcel and Nelly Tilloy purchased “La Cardinale”, an estate in the Rhône Valley. In 1952 the Tilloys began recruiting other hoteliers and restaurant owners that shared the same standards of quality, passion, and excellence. In 1954, this group of kindred spirits merged together to create Relais & Châteaux.
                
                Initially, there were only 8 establishments along the road between Paris and the French Riviera. Today more than 520 members form part of Relais & Châteaux.</p>
