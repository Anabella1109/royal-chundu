            <h1>Building Zambia's Future
            </h1>
            <h2>Help Us Build a School</h2>
            <p>Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. – Nelson Mandela

                    We are thrilled to announce some big plans for  The Royal Chundu Foundation School, at Royal Chundu in Zambia, in our hopes to offer and create quality education, close to home, to even more people in the local area around us.
                    
                    We are building a new and bigger school to hold more students, and aim to school around 500 kids a year, from early education to 12th grade, with an adult literacy programme, online hospitality programme and a culinary school, linked to the chefs at Royal Chundu. We hope to provide even more students with tablets loaded with the Zambian curriculum,  as we do currently.  Our students will also be provided with a healthy breakfast and lunch each day.
                    
                    To raise funds for this project, we are appealing to you, our guests, suppliers, partners, travellers, companies, individuals around the globe, to play a part.</p>

                    If everyone does a little bit of good for someone else, the power of that collectively has the potential to change hundreds, thousands, of lives. We believe in doing good and walking the talk, in the power of positivity and the butterfly effect. It’s not conventional, but we want to do something that has an impact greater than us, with infinite butterfly wings spreading good vibrations.
